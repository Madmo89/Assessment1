        <div class="text">Art has always been a big part of my life. Thought I haven't had much time to do anything creative, I am hopeful that this new path I have started will finally allow me to get my creative juices flowing again.</div>

        </h3>
        <div class="text">Going hand in hand with the others, writing is it's own form of art. The inspirations that come from art and reading push me to do to my own storytelling. Weaving words together to form a beautiful, though sometimes dark, painting that the reader paints inside their own head. </div>
